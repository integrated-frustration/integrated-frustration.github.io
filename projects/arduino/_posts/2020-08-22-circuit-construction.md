### Circuit Construction

1. The circuit was made using EasyEDAâ€™s platform; it's completely free and can be downloaded from [here][easyeda]{:target="_blank"}.

2. The circuit file can be downloaded from [here][circuit]{:target="_blank"}.

3. After you perform your analysis on the circuit you can then move to the PCB design stage.

4. In EasyEDA click `Design > Convert Schematic to PCB > No, Keep Going`. A shortcut is just pressing `Alt + P`.

5. It will ask you then for board measurements. You can use the standard Arduino Uno specifications found [here][unospec]{:target="_blank"}.

    Tip: If you want to save time and not make the right indentations just make the board using the max dimensions of $$L \times B = (2.7 \times 2.1) inch$$

6. You can now restructure, modify the PCB any way you wish! Save the file and use any PCB manufacturer of your choosing.

### Circuit Decoding

1. If you want to just see what connects where open the schematic file from [here][schematic]{:target="_blank"} or see the image below.

2. Open the generated Gerber file from [here][gerber]{:target="_blank"} and then trace the path of the components.
