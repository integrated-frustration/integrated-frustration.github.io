### What is going on in a flight controller!?

A flight controller or flight control unit (FCU) is a hub that monitors and controls the inputs and outputs of a drone. 
{:.def}

The 2 critical pieces of hardware that connect directly to the flight controller are the [ESCs][esc]{:target="_blank"} and the [Radio Receiver][rec]{:target="_blank"}. It translates high-level commands from the Radio Receiver like "Increase throttle" or "Pitch forward" into electronic commands to each of the ESCs, and thus the motors. 

### Why choose a Navio2?

The Navio2 is a shield for a Raspberry Pi. We found it to be:
* Easy to use - there's a lot of official documentaion by [Emlid][eml]{:target="_blank"} and [Ardupilot][ardu]{:target="_blank"}, as well as a community [forum][forum]{:target="_blank"} that has helped us at every step.
* Extensible - it runs Linux, can be programmed and can be used in other projects (e.g. Rover, Boat, Robot Arm, etc)

### What are flight modes and how do I choose the right ones? 

Flight modes are programmed states the drone enters to behave in some special way. 
{:.def}

Some commonly used ones are:
* [Stabilize][stab]{:target="_blank"} - the autopilot levels off after a manual input
* [AltHold][alt]{:target="_blank"} - the autopilot tries to maintain its current altitude
* [Land][land]{:target="_blank"} - the autopilot tries to bring the drone straight down for a landing

You can assign various modes to your RC Transmitter [switches][flightmode]{:target="_blank"} and cycle through them during flight (e.g. Stablize -> AltHold -> Land). Here is an exhaustive [list][allmodes]{:target="_blank"}
 
### What type of frame should I choose and why are some frames so expensive?

When choosing your frame, you should ask the following questions:
* Is the material of the drone made of carbon fiber or another strong plastic blend?
* Does the drone have any FPV/camera mounting slots?
* Is the frame lightweight?
* Is a drone that has a protective rail around the blades useful for me?

[Here][oscar]{:target="_blank"} is great resource to get started!
{:.rec}

Once you have selected all your hardware you should also check if the frame is big enough to house all the hardware as well as some extra room for the heat generating components like the video transmitter.
Drone frames can be expensive because of the quality of material used, aerodynamic design and the rigour of testing they undergo especially for premium companies.

###  What are some YouTube channels to get started with drones? 
These are the channels we consulted in our research and development process. They offer advice on components, explain flight dynamics and give reviews:

* [DroneBot Workshop][DroneBot]{:target="_blank"}
* [Joshua Bardwell][Joshua]{:target="_blank"}
* [Albert Kim][Albert]{:target="_blank"}
* [Gal Kremer][Gal]{:target="_blank"}

### Is it worth doing the advanced drone operation exam in Canada for recreational light flying?

The short answer is __No__. 

The reasons for this are:
* Even though the cost of the advanced exam may be cheap, learning to fly at an approved drone school is expensive. Also, as a beginner, you're quite likey to fail the practical exam! It makes more sense to take your time and practice on a simulator/unrestricted airspace. Then, use the flight school to perfect your theory and technique.

* If your drone is a DIY drone, getting permission is not possible. The drone must be on the approved list on Transport Canadaâ€™s website [here.][TC]{:target="_blank"}

* If you do manage to attain an advanced license you would need to still seek permission each time you want to fly in restricted airspace and follow all the additional rules/restrictions that may be provided by Transport Canada. In most cases, you would need to purchase insurance for your drone. It's also worth mentioning that getting permission to fly in areas with large populations, gatherings and flight traffic is rarely approved for recreational flying

But all that said. If after attaining your drone license and practicing yourself you feel ready for the challenge, it may be worth applying and taking advantage of the license. The main advantages are that you can fly in areas closer to home and scenic spots that fall under restricted airspace (with appropriate permission).
