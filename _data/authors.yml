    Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineering student who is enthusiastic about power and process engineering. 
    In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with electronics, learning investment management and automating daily tasks. 
    Together, these contribute towards my goal of bringing sustainability to finance, technology and energy.

    My goal is to integrate knowledge across disciplines and apply them to holistic technological systems. 
    Breakthroughs in AI, Biology and Video Games always seem to energize me, whereas learning about Culture, Fantasy and History help me relax. 
    Formally, I'm studying Cognitive Science, Psychology and Computer Science.
