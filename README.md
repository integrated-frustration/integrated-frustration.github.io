# Integrated Frustration

Hello! This repo contains the source code for our [website](https://integrated-frustration.github.io/). 

## Website Customizations

We have used the [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/) theme as a basis for the website. We are very grateful to [qwtel](https://github.com/qwtel) for making this free, customizable and elegant theme.

The most significant deviations from the original include:
1. The [Gallery](https://integrated-frustration.github.io/gallery/) which is contained within `gallery.md`.
2. The [Projects](https://integrated-frustration.github.io/projects/) page which adapts the categories in `_featured_categories` and displays them using `projects/project_showcase` and the custom `_layouts/list.html`.
3. The overriding and extension of various CSS classes as written in `_sass/my-inline.scss`.  


We would love to hear from you for any feedback on our work! Please reach out to [us!](https://integrated-frustration.github.io/)
